!!! -Fix server session ( try to use tokens instead of session).
!!! -Fix storing currentUser in Angular (in auth.js -> currentUser : undefined) => resolve routes not working correctly.
!!! -Return author names when filtering by hash tag. Code is run asynchronously => should be written better or use mongoose-text-plugin (for populate) instead of mongoose-text-search.
!!! Escape html when showing messages, allow html only under special conditions(for example some <a></a> tags).
- Make hash tag filtering execute only once.
- Replace input type text with input type email in login.html.
